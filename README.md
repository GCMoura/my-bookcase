## Getting Started
This page was created using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript, with ReactJS.

## How it works

First of all, the user needs to register with a username and password. So, the user can log in and start to register your books, informing the title, the author, the genre, inserting a cover, and give a note for the book.
